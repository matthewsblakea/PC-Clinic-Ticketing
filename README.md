# PC Clinic Ticketing

PC Clinic is a fictional company that performs repairs and consultations for clients for their PCs and other technology needs. Services include hardware repair/replacement, software and OS fixes, and consultations, with options for in-shop work, site visits, and remote support. I made it up to create an IT ticketing system as an exercise.
In the absence of any actual business activites the app is a straightforward CRUD application using SQLite and a webpage front-end.
